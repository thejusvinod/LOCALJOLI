LOCALJOLI is a joblisting platform that has been developed mainly to decrease unemployment.In India we only have job listing platforms for white collar jobs whereas the other people who are not  educated but have skills in local jobs like plumbing,gardening etc.. find it difficult to find jobs.So LOCALJOLI is used by the people to reduce the difficulty to find a local job.In LOCALJOLI the employers can also post the requirements of worker so that worker can directly contact the employer.The employer can also choose from a wide variety of workers that are listed in the platform and can filter them out on the basis of their rating,skills,yers of experience and many more.So,LOCALJOLI sloves the problem of both employee and the employers in finding the right job and right worker.
